This is my first completed data science hackathon project. The first "official" hackaton was done about 4 months ago, when I didn't know much about data science, and thought it was a data analytics project. And without any good knowledge, I couldn't complete it at all. 

So, even though the result of the current model of this hackathon is far from perfect, it is still progress. Looking forward to doing more data science projects
